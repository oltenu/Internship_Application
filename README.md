# Internship_Application
I've implemented this project using Spring Boot, JPA, Rest API, MySQL, Lombok.
If you want to run it you will need MySQL.

The DEMO is implemented using Rest API and for running it you have to make the following Rest calls:
http://localhost:9090/demo/init -- This is mandatory to be called first to initiate the database and populate it.
http://localhost:9090/demo/jobs-by-employer
http://localhost:9090/demo/applicants-by-employer
http://localhost:9090/demo/applicants-by-job
http://localhost:9090/demo/delete-a-job
http://localhost:9090/demo/display-jobs
http://localhost:9090/demo/display-employers
http://localhost:9090/demo/display-applicants
